ML Models & Algorithms Used
1️⃣ Loan Approval Prediction (Classification)

    Algorithm: XGBoostClassifier
    Purpose: Determines whether a loan should be approved (True/False).
    Features Used (After Feature Selection & Engineering):
        Status of existing checking account, credit history, purpose
        Duration of credit, loan amount, savings account status
        Employment status, installment rate, personal status/sex
        Other debtors, property ownership, age, other installment plans
        Number of existing credits, job type, telephone, foreign worker status
    Why XGBoost?
        Handles imbalanced classification well (scale_pos_weight)
        Boosted trees capture complex patterns in financial risk analysis
        Offers strong regularization and feature selection benefits

Current ML Model Metrics

Accuracy
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    The ratio of correct predictions (both approved and denied loans) to total predictions.
    Formula:
    Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
    Meaning: Of all test samples, how many did the model get right overall?

Precision
prec = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)

    Out of all the predicted loan approvals, how many were actually correct?
    Formula:
    Precision = True Positives / True Positives + False Positives
    Meaning: If the model says "Loan Approved," how often is it actually correct?

Recall
rec = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)

    Out of all truly approvable loans, how many does the model catch?
    Formula:
    Recall = True Positives / True Positives + False Negatives
    Meaning: If a loan should be approved, how often does the model actually approve it?

2️⃣ Chosen Acceptance Thresholds

    assert acc > 0.75 → Want at least 75% of all predictions to be correct.
    assert prec > 0.70 → Want at least 70% of approved loans to be the correct decision.
    assert rec > 0.65 → Want at least 65% of truly approvable loans to be predicted as approved.
