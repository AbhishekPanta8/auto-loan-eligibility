ML Models & Algorithms Used
1️⃣ Loan Approval Prediction (Classification)
Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier
Purpose: Determines whether a loan should be approved (True/False).
Features Used:
- Age, employment status, annual income, existing debt
- Debt-to-income ratio, credit score, credit history length
- Missed payments, loan amount requested, preferred term
- Collateral availability
Works well with tabular financial data.

2️⃣ Loan Amount Estimation (Regression)
Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor
Purpose: Predicts the loan amount that will likely be approved.
Why Random Forest Regression?
- Captures non-linear relationships between loan eligibility and approved loan amounts.

3️⃣ Interest Rate Prediction (Regression)
Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor
Purpose: Estimates the interest rate a customer is likely to receive.
Why Random Forest Regression?
Captures complex dependencies between creditworthiness and interest rates.
Works well with financial datasets that have non-linear trends.
