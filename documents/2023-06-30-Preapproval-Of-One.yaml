    # Introduction
    
      Equifax's Pre-Approval of One allows consumers to  initiate an application for credit with no impact to their credit score. Lender evaluates applicant's creditworthiness and offers a commitment to lend, subject only to collateral requirements or conditions. A hard inquiry will be posted if the consumer moves forward with taking the pre-approved offer and meets the conditional credit requirements.

    # Getting Started


    1. **<a href="/user/applications" target="_blank">Create</a>** an
    application


    2. **<a href="/user/applications" target="_blank">Subscribe</a>** to Preapproval-of-One
    API


    3. **<a href="/products/apiproducts/pre-approval-one" target="_blank">Explore</a>** the Sandbox
    environment mode


    # Promoting to UAT


    To successfully submit test transactions through your application in the UAT
    environment, a test member number is required.  In some cases, you may use your existing
    Equifax test member number(s).  Please contact your Equifax Account
    Representative if a new test member number is needed. The steps below can be
    used to test in the UAT environment.


    Transactions generated using a test member number do not return identical
    results as a sandbox transaction.  A sandbox transaction will reflect most
    everything that is exposed in the API whereas a test member number is
    configured to align with the specifications of your contract. Please contact
    your Equifax Account Representative to ensure your test member number is
    configured to your expectations.    


    1. **<a href="/user/applications" target="_blank">Promote</a>** application
    to test


    2. Update requests details for UAT.  For instance, ensure your actual test member number and desired security code are in the appropriate fields on the request.  Also, don't for get to send the request to the UAT endpoint URL.


    3. Test scenarios in UAT
    environment.  See the "CTEST 20k Test" files in the Additional API Docs tab 
    for many usable test cases.

                      - A: Inquiry SSN is associated with another consumer - SSN
                      Mismatch
                        The social security number provided in the inquiry matches
                        to another consumer on the Equifax database. A credit file
                        is returned for the consumer name and address provided,
                        however the social security number on that file is different
                        from the social security number provided on the inquiry.
                        
                      - B: Inquiry SSN not present 
                        Inquiry did not contain a social security number, 
                        therefore no comparison can be made.
                          
                      - N: No Alert available
                        The social security number provided in the inquiry 
                        cannot be matched to a specific consumer based
                        on the Equifax proprietary comparison algorithm.
                        
                      - P: Inquiry SSN is associated with the consumer
                        The social security number provided in the inquiry
                        matches to the requested consumer.
                        
                      - V*: SSN affirm variation 
                        Inquiry ssn has a slight variation with consumer. 
                        The social security number provided in the inquiry
                        has a slight variation to the requested consumer.

                        The social security number provided in the inquiry
                        matches to another consumer in the Equifax database. 
                        No credit file is available for the requested consumer.

                      The following indicator codes can be returned in the

                         - Q: Active Duty Alert with Fraud Victim "Initial Alert"

                         - V: Fraud Victim "Initial Alert"
                         - W: Active Duty Alert with Fraud Victim "Extended Alert"
                         - X: Fraud Victim "Extended Alert"

                      Consumers or their representatives may request that an
                      Initial Fraud Alert or, if the consumer is a member of the
                      military on active duty, an Active Duty Alert be placed on
                      their credit file. The Initial Fraud Alert will remain on
                      the credit file for one year (366 days); the Active Duty
                      Alert will remain on file for twelve months. Equifax will
                      return an "N", "Q", or "V", as applicable, in the Header
                      segment.

                      A user receiving a report containing an Initial Fraud
                      Alert or Active Duty Alert may not grant credit without
                      first determining the identity of the person making the
                      request. If the consumer has provided a telephone number,
                      it will be returned in a second Consumer Narrative
                      Statement segment or Alert Contact segment and must be
                      used for identity verification purposes before granting
                      credit.
                      
                      Since only one value is returned in the code property, a 
                      more \"substantial\" code like T or R may be returned but 
                      this does not preclude an extended alert from  being in 
                      place. As such, it is recommended to examine the 
                      alertContacts object for the presence of initial/extended
                      alerts. Alert Contacts are only returned when there is an
                      alert contact specified present on the consumer's file. 
                      See the alertContact object for more information.

                      North American Link is an option, which interconnects the U.S. and Canadian
                      systems to allow customers on either side of the border to receive a National
                      credit report as well as an International credit report by using a single inquiry.
                      For future reference U.S. will be referred to as National and Canada will be
                      referred to as International.

                      North American Link is an optional service offered by Equifax and will only
                      be returned when the member number is validated for North American Link
                      International.

                      When the fixed inquiry is received, the Province/State code will be
                      examined and it will be determined if the transaction contains an
                      International address in the current or former addresses. If the inquiry contains only 
                      National (U.S.) addresses, normal processing will occur and only a National (U.S.) 
                      report will be returned. If the inquiry contains only an International (Canadian) address, 
                      only an International report will be returned.

                      The models request object cannot be sent if a Canadian address is
                      present in the inquiry. Otherwise, CERR 07A will be returned.

                          information should be independently verified to form a
